            <p id="para1">Boston is a beautiful city with a rich history that dates back to the eighteenth century. Unfortunately, beyond the tourist traps and bustling food industry, it can be difficult to find much to do around the city, especially for a local who has lived here for years. We wanted to create a web application that would help those searching for exciting and unique events and activities to alleviate their boredom, and mayhap expand their hobbies in the process. Go To Boston strives to make Boston fun for those who have grown tired of it.</p>
            <h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
            <p id="para2">We had originally wanted to design a web application that would recommend the worst restaurants to go in Boston. What the user would do with that information would be up to them. But we had since shifted to recommending the best places to go for activities to highlight Boston's better side rather than its worst.</p>
